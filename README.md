# mTRAQ_library_prediction

Peptides are made identifiable in LC-MS/MS due to their predictable characteristics (e.g. retention time, ion-mobility, MS1 precursor m/z, and MS2 fragment m/z's). While these characteristics are largely predictable with high accuracy for label-free peptides due to overwhelming experimental and analytical work spanning decades, there is need for a stream-lined workflow to predict these characteristics for labeled peptides (e.g. mTRAQ or TMT) to improve identifications. 

Here, experical ion-mobility (IM) and MS2-spectral data from mTRAQ-labeled peptides were used to build a deep learning model to predict these characteristics, with the goal of increasing the number of identifications, and thus proteomic coverage.
